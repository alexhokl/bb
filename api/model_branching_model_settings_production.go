type BranchingModelSettingsProduction struct {
	// Indicates if the configured branch is valid, that is, if the configured branch actually exists currently. Is always `true` when `use_mainbranch` is `true` (even if the main branch does not exist). This field is read-only. This field is ignored when updating/creating settings.
	IsValid bool `json:"is_valid,omitempty"`
	// The configured branch. It must be `null` when `use_mainbranch` is `true`. Otherwise it must be a non-empty value. It is possible for the configured branch to not exist (e.g. it was deleted after the settings are set). In this case `is_valid` will be `false`. The branch must exist when updating/setting the `name` or an error will occur.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Indicates if the setting points at an explicit branch (`false`) or tracks the main branch (`true`). When `true` the `name` must be `null` or not provided. When `false` the `name` must contain a non-empty branch name.
	UseMainbranch bool `json:"use_mainbranch,omitempty"`
	// Optional and only returned for a repository's branching model. Indicates ifthe indicated branch exists on the repository (`false`)or not (`true`). This is useful for determining a fallback to the mainbranch when a repository is inheriting its project's branching model.
	BranchDoesNotExist bool `json:"branch_does_not_exist,omitempty"`
	// Indicates if branch is enabled or not.
	Enabled bool `json:"enabled,omitempty"`
